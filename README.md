# TExplorer
So TExplorer is a tool for Windows 10 or 11(or lower maybe) 
Anyway,

TEXPLORER IS A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO USE EXPLORER(a little different) WITH SYSTEM PRIVILEGES, SO USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THIS IS 99% RECOMMENDED FOR EITHER EDUCATIONAL OR FOR VITRUAL MACHINES OR FOR REMOVING THINGS
THAT MAKES YOUR COMUTER UNUSABLE OR SO, SO ANY DAMAGE DONE, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE, INCLUDING, PAYING, FIXING, BUYING, OR IN ANY SORT OF DAMAGE DONE.

Sorry for writing in caps but seriously use this at your own risk.

Anyway,
